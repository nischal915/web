        <h1>Unit 2: Number System and Boolean Logic</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Number Systems</h2>
    <p>Computers use different number systems to represent data. These systems include decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.</p>

    <h2>Decimal Number System</h2>
    <p>The decimal system is base 10, used in everyday arithmetic. It includes digits from 0 to 9.</p>

    <h2>Binary Number System</h2>
    <p>The binary system is base 2, used by computers for processing. It includes only two digits: 0 and 1.</p>

    <h2>Octal Number System</h2>
    <p>The octal system is base 8, sometimes used in programming. It includes digits from 0 to 7.</p>

    <h2>Hexadecimal Number System</h2>
    <p>The hexadecimal system is base 16, commonly used in programming and web design. It includes digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F.</p>

    <h2>Conversion Between Number Systems</h2>
    <p>Converting between these systems is essential for programming and computer operations:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Binary:</strong> Divide by 2 until quotient is 0.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each digit by 2^n from right to left.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Octal:</strong> Divide by 8 until quotient is 0.</li>
            <li><strong>Octal to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each digit by 8^n from right to left.</li>
            <li><strong>Decimal to Hexadecimal:</strong> Divide by 16 until quotient is 0.</li>
            <li><strong>Hexadecimal to Decimal:</strong> Multiply each digit by 16^n from right to left.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Binary Arithmetic Operations</h2>
    <p>Binary arithmetic involves addition and subtraction:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Addition:</strong> Similar to decimal addition but with carry rules for binary.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Subtraction:</strong> Can be performed using one's complement or two's complement methods.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>One’s and Two’s Complement Methods</h2>
    <p>These methods are used for binary subtraction:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>One’s Complement:</strong> Invert all bits, then add 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Two’s Complement:</strong> Invert all bits, add 1, and discard the carry.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Boolean Algebra</h2>
    <p>Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean Values:</strong> True (1) and False (0).</li>
            <li><strong>Truth Tables:</strong> Tables used to evaluate Boolean expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Boolean Expressions:</strong> Combinations of variables and operators.</li>
            <li><strong>Boolean Functions:</strong> Functions that return Boolean values.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Logic Gates</h2>
    <p>Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AND Gate:</strong> Returns True if both inputs are True.</li>
            <li><strong>OR Gate:</strong> Returns True if either input is True.</li>
            <li><strong>NOT Gate:</strong> Inverts the input.</li>
            <li><strong>NAND Gate:</strong> Returns True if not both inputs are True.</li>
            <li><strong>NOR Gate:</strong> Returns True if neither input is True.</li>
            <li><strong>XOR Gate:</strong> Returns True if inputs are different.</li>
            <li><strong>XNOR Gate:</strong> Returns True if inputs are the same.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Laws of Boolean Algebra</h2>
    <p>These laws govern how Boolean expressions can be manipulated:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boolean Identities:</strong> A AND A = A, A OR A = A.</li>
            <li><strong>Complement Laws:</strong> A AND NOT A = 0, A OR NOT A = 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity Laws:</strong> A AND 1 = A, A OR 0 = A.</li>
            <li><strong>Commutative Laws:</strong> A AND B = B AND A, A OR B = B OR A.</li>
            <li><strong>Associative Laws:</strong> (A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C), (A OR B) OR C = A OR (B OR C).</li>
            <li><strong>Distributive Laws:</strong> A AND (B OR C) = (A AND B) OR (A AND C), A OR (B AND C) = (A OR B) AND (A OR C).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Verification of Laws Using Truth Tables</h2>
    <p>Truth tables are used to verify the validity of Boolean laws by evaluating all possible combinations of inputs.</p>

    <h2>Applications of Boolean Logic</h2>
    <p>Boolean logic is fundamental in digital electronics and computer programming, used in designing digital circuits and algorithms. It is also applied in decision-making processes and data analysis.</p>
