    <h2>Components of Computer System</h2>
    <p>The main components are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Unit:</strong> Devices that send data to the computer, such as keyboards, mice, and scanners.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Unit:</strong> Devices that display or print data, including monitors, printers, and speakers.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing Unit:</strong> The CPU performs calculations and executes instructions, acting as the brain of the computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory Unit:</strong> Temporary storage for data being processed, such as RAM.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Unit:</strong> Permanent storage for data and programs, such as hard drives and SSDs.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Microprocessor</h2>
    <p>A microprocessor is the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, responsible for executing instructions. It includes components like the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and control unit. Key specifications include clock speed (measured in Hz) and word length (number of bits processed at once). Modern microprocessors are designed to optimize performance and power efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Bus System</h2>
    <p>The bus system allows different components to communicate. It consists of:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> Transfers data between components.</li>
            <li><strong>Address Bus:</strong> Specifies memory locations for data transfer.</li>
