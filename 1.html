        <h2>What is a Computer System?</h2>
        <p>A computer system is a collection of hardware and software components that work together to process data and perform tasks. The major components of a computer system include the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input devices, and output devices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Components of a Computer System</h2>

        <h3>1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
        <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It processes instructions and performs calculations. The CPU controls the flow of data between the computer's hardware and software.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Components: Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), and Registers</li>
            <li>Functions: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Store</li>
            <li>Clock speed, measured in GHz, determines the processing speed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Memory</h3>
        <p>Memory in a computer is used to store data temporarily or permanently. There are two types of memory: primary memory (RAM) and secondary memory (hard drives or SSDs).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong>: Volatile memory used to store data actively in use by the CPU. It is fast but loses its contents when the power is turned off.</li>
            <li><strong>Cache Memory</strong>: A small, high-speed memory located inside the CPU that stores frequently used instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory)</strong>: Non-volatile memory used to store firmware (permanent instructions that help boot the computer).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Storage Devices</h3>
        <p>Storage devices are used to store data permanently or for long-term access. The two main categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Storage</strong>: Fast, temporary storage like RAM.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Storage</strong>: Devices like hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and optical drives (CD/DVD).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Input Devices</h3>
        <p>Input devices allow users to interact with the computer and provide data for processing. Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
            <li>Scanner</li>
            <li>Microphone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Output Devices</h3>
        <p>Output devices display or produce results from the computer after processing. Common examples are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor</li>
            <li>Printer</li>
            <li>Speakers</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Operating System (OS)</h2>
        <p>The operating system is software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Examples of OS: Windows, macOS, Linux</li>
            <li>Functions: Process management, memory management, file system management, and security.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Networking in Computer Systems</h2>
        <p>Networking allows computers to communicate with each other and share resources. A computer system may be connected to the internet or a local network (LAN).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet</strong>: A global network connecting millions of computers worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong>: A network connecting computers in a small area, like an office or home.</li>
        </ul>
